couchdb (0.10.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Elliot Murphy ]
  * Updated debian/control, added Elliot to Uploaders
  * Dropped $ENABLE_SERVER portion of debian/patches/init.patch

  [ Sam Bisbee ]
  * Updated debian/patches/init.patch, adding a grace period to the init
    script's stop task to allow couchdb's child processes (ie., heart) a chance
    to exit before deciding whether the task was successful or not. This adds a
    dependency on procps (`ps` command).
  * Removed debian/preinst, undoing killall preinst patch from 0.10.0-1 that is
    no longer needed due to the grace period init patch in this release. This 
    also removes the dependency on psmisc. (closes: #562901) 
  * Updated debian/control, bumping Debian standards version to 3.8.4.
  * Updated debian/control, adding mawk as a dependency. The majority of
    systems will have it installed with the base system, but it's required and
    not essential. (closes: #569965)

couchdb (0.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #550782). 
  * Cleaning up nmu related lintian warnings.

couchdb (0.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Elliot Murphy ]
  * Updated debian/copyright, added src/etap*
  * Updated debian/control, changed Maintainer to Erlang team address
  * Updated debian/control, changed Vcs- links to new locations.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (closes: #551212, #554080, #554593).
  * Removed unnecessary build dependency on transitional erlang-nox package.
  * Replaced subst variables in dependencies by ${erlang:Depends} which allows
    to calculate dependencies automatically. This removes erlang-nox from
    dependencies (closes: #532756).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.
  * It's normal if /etc/init.d script is left after package removal as a
    config file (and the binary isn't available). Therefore made it return
    success in case if /usr/bin/couchdb doesn't exist or isn't an executable.
  * Change current directory to /var/run/couchdb in init script to prevent
    error messages about access violation by code server if the current dir
    isn't readable by the couchdb user.
  * Put log files directly into /var/log/couchdb directory. There's no reason
    to have different log subdirectories for different couchdb versions.

  [ Noah Slater ]
  * Updated debian/control, updated Build-Depends on debhelper to 7.2.11.

  [ Sam Bisbee ]
  * Updated debian/control, repointed Vcs links.
  * Fix "replacing libreadline5-dev build dependency with libreadline-
    dev" Updated debian/control, changed libreadline5-dev dependency to
    libreadline-dev. (Closes: #553742)
  * Updated debian/README.Debian, removed log directory partitioning info
    per Sergei's related changes to put all logs in one directory.
  * Updated debian/postrm, rmdir didn't like that its target directories
    weren't non-empty (despite passed args), causing errors and failing to
    remove directories. Also removed the version partitioning cases.
  * Created debian/preinst, now we make sure that couchdb isn't running any
    beam processes on upgrade. Upgrading from 0.9.0-2 was leaving old code in a
    running beam process, so you were running 0.9.0 couchdb but had 0.10.0 code
    installed until you killed the process. Adds a dependency on psmisc.
